## Sharing work-in Progress
This project will use localtunnel. First install like any other node package.

Second, start development server.

Third type the following command on the comand line 'lt -- port <port used localy>'  This comand will return a url you can shar3e with others to allow them to see your work.

To make URL more readable, use this flag '--subdomain=<name>'.
